# 多客户端服务器的OpenVPN 2.0配置文件示例          #
#                                               #
# 本文件用于多客户端<->单服务器端的                #
# OpenVPN服务器端配置                            #
#                                               #
# OpenVPN也支持单机<->单机的配置                  #
# (在网站上的示例页面更多信息)                    #
#                                               #
# 这个配置可以在Windows或Linux/BSD系统上工作。     #
# Windows的路径名需要加双引号并使用双反斜杠，如：   #
# "C:\\Program Files\\OpenVPN\\config\\foo.key" #
#                                               #
# 前面加'#'或';'的是注释                          #

# OpenVPN应该监听哪个本地IP地址（可选）
# 如果不设置，默认监听所有IP
;local a.b.c.d

# OpenVPN应该监听哪个端口(TCP/UDP)
# 如果想在同一台计算机上运行多个OpenVPN实例，可以使用不同的端口号来区分它们
# 在防火墙上打开这个端口
port 1194

# 服务器使用TCP还是UDP协议
;proto tcp
proto udp

# 指定OpenVPN创建的通信隧道类型
# "dev tun"将会创建一个路由IP隧道
# "dev tap"将会创建一个以太网隧道
# 如果是以太网桥接模式，并且提前创建了一个名为"tap0"的与以太网接口进行桥接的虚拟接口，则你可以使用"dev tap0"
# 如果想控制VPN的访问策略，必须为TUN/TAP接口创建防火墙规则
# 在非Windows系统中，可以给出明确的单位编号，如"tun0"
# 在Windows中，也可以使用"dev-node"
# 在大多数系统上，除非部分或完全禁用了TUN/TAP接口的防火墙，否则VPN将不起作用。
;dev tap
dev tun

# 如果想配置多个隧道，需要用到网络连接面板中TAP-Win32适配器的名称(如"MyTap")
# 在XP SP2或更高版本的系统中，可能需要有选择地禁用掉针对TAP适配器的防火墙
# 通常情况下，非Windows系统则不需要该指令。
;dev-node MyTap

# 设置SSL/TLS根证书(ca)、证书(cert)和私钥(key)。
# 每个客户端和服务器端都需要它们各自的证书和私钥文件。
# 服务器端和所有的客户端都将使用相同的CA证书文件。
#
# 通过easy-rsa目录下的一系列脚本可以生成所需的证书和私钥。
# 服务器端和每个客户端的证书必须使用唯一的Common Name。
#
# 也可以使用遵循X509标准的任何密钥管理系统来生成证书和私钥。
# OpenVPN也支持使用一个PKCS #12格式的密钥文件(详情查看站点手册页面的"pkcs12"指令)
ca ca.crt
cert server.crt
key server.key  # 该文件应该保密

# 迪菲·赫尔曼参数
# 使用如下命令生成：
#   openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048
dh dh2048.pem

# 网络拓扑结构
# 应该为子网(通过IP寻址)
# 除非必须支持Windows客户端v2.0.9及更低版本(net30即每个客户端/30)
# 默认为"net30"(不建议)
;topology subnet

# 设置服务器端模式，并提供一个VPN子网，以从中为客户端分配IP地址
# 本例中服务器端自身占用10.8.0.1，其他的将分配给客户端使用
# 每个客户端将能够通过10.8.0.1访问服务器
# 如果使用的是以太网桥接模式，注释掉本行。更多信息请查看官方手册页面。
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0

# Maintain a record of client <-> virtual IP address
# associations in this file.  If OpenVPN goes down or
# is restarted, reconnecting clients can be assigned
# the same virtual IP address from the pool that was
# previously assigned.

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging.
# You must first use your OS's bridging capability
# to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet
# NIC interface.  Then you must manually set the
# IP/netmask on the bridge interface, here we
# assume 10.8.0.4/255.255.255.0.  Finally we
# must set aside an IP range in this subnet
# (start=10.8.0.50 end=10.8.0.100) to allocate
# to connecting clients.  Leave this line commented
# out unless you are ethernet bridging.
;server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.50 10.8.0.100

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging
# using a DHCP-proxy, where clients talk
# to the OpenVPN server-side DHCP server
# to receive their IP address allocation
# and DNS server addresses.  You must first use
# your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP
# interface with the ethernet NIC interface.
# Note: this mode only works on clients (such as
# Windows), where the client-side TAP adapter is
# bound to a DHCP client.
;server-bridge

# Push routes to the client to allow it
# to reach other private subnets behind
# the server.  Remember that these
# private subnets will also need
# to know to route the OpenVPN client
# address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)
# back to the OpenVPN server.
;push "route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0"
;push "route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0"

# To assign specific IP addresses to specific
# clients or if a connecting client has a private
# subnet behind it that should also have VPN access,
# use the subdirectory "ccd" for client-specific
# configuration files (see man page for more info).

# EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
# having the certificate common name "Thelonious"
# also has a small subnet behind his connecting
# machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
# First, uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
#   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# This will allow Thelonious' private subnet to
# access the VPN.  This example will only work
# if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
# using "dev tun" and "server" directives.

# EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
# Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
# First uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252
# Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
#   ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2

# Suppose that you want to enable different
# firewall access policies for different groups
# of clients.  There are two methods:
# (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
#     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
#     for each group/daemon appropriately.
# (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
#     modify the firewall in response to access
#     from different clients.  See man
#     page for more info on learn-address script.
;learn-address ./script

# If enabled, this directive will configure
# all clients to redirect their default
# network gateway through the VPN, causing
# all IP traffic such as web browsing and
# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN
# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT
# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet
# in order for this to work properly).
;push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

# Certain Windows-specific network settings
# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS
# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:
# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats
# The addresses below refer to the public
# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"

# Uncomment this directive to allow different
# clients to be able to "see" each other.
# By default, clients will only see the server.
# To force clients to only see the server, you
# will also need to appropriately firewall the
# server's TUN/TAP interface.
;client-to-client

# Uncomment this directive if multiple clients
# might connect with the same certificate/key
# files or common names.  This is recommended
# only for testing purposes.  For production use,
# each client should have its own certificate/key
# pair.
#
# IF YOU HAVE NOT GENERATED INDIVIDUAL
# CERTIFICATE/KEY PAIRS FOR EACH CLIENT,
# EACH HAVING ITS OWN UNIQUE "COMMON NAME",
# UNCOMMENT THIS LINE OUT.
;duplicate-cn

# The keepalive directive causes ping-like
# messages to be sent back and forth over
# the link so that each side knows when
# the other side has gone down.
# Ping every 10 seconds, assume that remote
# peer is down if no ping received during
# a 120 second time period.
keepalive 10 120

# For extra security beyond that provided
# by SSL/TLS, create an "HMAC firewall"
# to help block DoS attacks and UDP port flooding.
#
# Generate with:
#   openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
#
# The server and each client must have
# a copy of this key.
# The second parameter should be '0'
# on the server and '1' on the clients.
tls-auth ta.key 0 # This file is secret

# Select a cryptographic cipher.
# This config item must be copied to
# the client config file as well.
# Note that v2.4 client/server will automatically
# negotiate AES-256-GCM in TLS mode.
# See also the ncp-cipher option in the manpage
cipher AES-256-CBC

# Enable compression on the VPN link and push the
# option to the client (v2.4+ only, for earlier
# versions see below)
;compress lz4-v2
;push "compress lz4-v2"

# For compression compatible with older clients use comp-lzo
# If you enable it here, you must also
# enable it in the client config file.
;comp-lzo

# The maximum number of concurrently connected
# clients we want to allow.
;max-clients 100

# It's a good idea to reduce the OpenVPN
# daemon's privileges after initialization.
#
# You can uncomment this out on
# non-Windows systems.
;user nobody
;group nobody

# The persist options will try to avoid
# accessing certain resources on restart
# that may no longer be accessible because
# of the privilege downgrade.
persist-key
persist-tun

# Output a short status file showing
# current connections, truncated
# and rewritten every minute.
status openvpn-status.log

# By default, log messages will go to the syslog (or
# on Windows, if running as a service, they will go to
# the "\Program Files\OpenVPN\log" directory).
# Use log or log-append to override this default.
# "log" will truncate the log file on OpenVPN startup,
# while "log-append" will append to it.  Use one
# or the other (but not both).
;log         openvpn.log
;log-append  openvpn.log

# Set the appropriate level of log
# file verbosity.
#
# 0 is silent, except for fatal errors
# 4 is reasonable for general usage
# 5 and 6 can help to debug connection problems
# 9 is extremely verbose
verb 3

# Silence repeating messages.  At most 20
# sequential messages of the same message
# category will be output to the log.
;mute 20

# Notify the client that when the server restarts so it
# can automatically reconnect.
